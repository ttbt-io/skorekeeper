                <p>
                    <strong>You are responsible for your data.</strong> While we employ industry-standard security measures (including encryption at rest) and synchronization mechanisms, data loss can occur due to software bugs, server failures, or network issues.

                <p>
                    The Service provides a built-in "Backup/Restore" feature. You agree to regularly backup your game data to your local device. We are not liable for any loss of data, history, or statistics.
                </p>

                <h3>4. User Accounts</h3>
